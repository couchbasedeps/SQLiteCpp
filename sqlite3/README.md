sqlite3
-------

### This is a one-off build of SQLite, not a release!!!

"sqlite3.c" and "sqlite3.h" files from sqlite-snapshot-202005081822. Version identifier is "3.32.0".

This build adds some extra-careful sanity checks around index updates, to hopefully detect index corruption earlier.

### License:

All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors.
